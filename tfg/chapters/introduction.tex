\chapter{Introduction}

In this chapter, we lay out the basic definitions of graph theoretical and topological concepts used in this thesis, as well as the background results which contextualize our research.

We follow the exposition of Diestel \cite{diestel}, of Mohar and Thomassen \cite{graphsonsurfaces}
and of Postle \cite{postlethesis}. 

\section{Graphs and Surfaces}


\subsection{Graph Theory Terminology}

\begin{definition}
A \emph{graph} $G$ is a pair $(V(G), E(G))$ consisting of a set $V(G)$ and a set $E(G)$ of two-
element subsets of $V(G)$. We call the elements of $V(G)$ vertices and
the elements $\{u, v\}$ of $E(G)$ edges, which we often denote as $uv$.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Surfaces}

\begin{definition}
A \emph{surface} is a connected compact $2$-dimensional manifold without boundary. 
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
The \emph{sphere} $S_0$ is the surface defined by the set $\{(x, y, z) \in \mathbb{R}^3 : x^2+y^2
+z^2 = 1\}$ with the euclidean metric inherited from $\mathbb{R}^3$. 

The \emph{torus} $S_1$ is the surface defined by the set $\{(x, y, z) \in \mathbb{R}^3 :  (\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} - 2)^2 + z^2 = 1\}$ with the euclidean metric inherited from $\mathbb{R}^3$.
\end{example}

Note that, even though we have defined the above example surfaces as geometric objects in
$\mathbb{R}^3$, we think of surfaces as \emph{topological} objects, and therefore consider two
surfaces equivalent if they are \emph{homeomorphic}. 

An important result in topology is that all surfaces defined in this way can be classified:

\begin{theorem}[Classification Theorem of Surfaces]
\label{classificationsurfacestheorem}
Every surface is homeomorphic to one of the following surfaces:

\begin{itemize}
	\item $S_0$, the sphere.
	\item $S_k$, the surface obtained from the sphere by performing the operation
	of \emph{adding a handle}  $k \geq 1$ times.
	\item $N_k$, the surface obtained from the sphere by performing the operation
	of \emph{adding a crosscap} $k \geq 1$ times.
\end{itemize}
\end{theorem}

The operation of \emph{adding a handle} in a surface $\Sigma$ can be thought of as deleting the 
interiors of two small  disks $T_1$ and $T_2$ from the surface $\Sigma$ and identifying
the boundaries of $T_1$ and $T_2$.
The operation of \emph{adding a crosscap} in a surface $\Sigma$ can be thought of as deleting the 
interior of a small disk $T$ of $\Sigma$ and identifying the diametrically opposite points of $T$.
In this thesis, we will be mainly concerned only with the two surfaces $S_0$ and $S_1$, so we 
do not delve into the topological details of this construction.

We often represent surfaces via their \emph{fundamental polygon}. A fundamental polygon is a 
polygon with a labelling and an orientation of its edges so that the corresponding surface is
obtained by identifying the edges with the same labels
along the specified orientations. Theorem \ref{classificationsurfacestheorem} can be restated
as that every surface is homeomorphic to a surface obtained from some type of fundamental
polygon. See Figure \ref{fig:spheretorusrepresentation} for representations of $S_0$ and $S_1$ as
fundamental polygons. 

\begin{figure}
\label{fig:spheretorusrepresentation}
\missingfigure{Sphere and torus representations}
\caption{Representation of $S_0$ and $S_1$ as embedded manifolds in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and as fundamental polygons.}
\end{figure}

Finally, we define the following topological invariant for surfaces:

\begin{definition}
The \emph{Euler characteristic} of a surface $\Sigma$ is $\chi(\Sigma) = 2 - 2k$ if $\Sigma = S_k$
and $\chi(\Sigma) = 2 - k$ if $\Sigma = N_k$. The \emph{Euler genus} of a surface $\Sigma$ is
$g(\Sigma) = 2 - \chi(\Sigma)$. 
\end{definition}

 

\subsection{Embedding Graphs in Surfaces}

Let $X$ be a topological space. 

\begin{definition}
An \emph{arc} in $X$ is the image of a continuous injective 
function $f : [0, 1] \rightarrow X$. A \emph{closed curve} in $X$ is the image
of a continuous injective function $f : S^1 \rightarrow X$, where $S^1$ is the circle.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
A \emph{graph embedded in $X$} is a graph $G$ in which each element
of $V(G)$ is a point in $X$ together with an associated arc $A_{uv}$ in $X$  each edge $uv \in E(G)$ whose 
interior is disjoint from any vertices of $G$ and whose endpoints are $u, v$. 
\end{definition}

The existence of an arc between two points of $X$ determines an equivalency relation which 
partitions $X$ into equivalence classes known as \emph{arcwise connected components}.

\begin{definition}
A \emph{face} of a graph $G$ embedded in $X$ is an arcwise connected component of
$X \setminus \bigcup_{uv \in E(G)} A_{uv}$. 

The graph $G$ is \emph{$2$-cell-embedded} if every face is homeomorphic to an open disk.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
A \emph{plane graph} is a graph $G$ embedded in the plane. A \emph{planar graph} is a graph $G$ for which there exists an embedding of $G$ into the plane. 

If $G$ is a plane graph, then there exists an unbounded face of $G$. We say 
that the boundary walk of the infinite face of $G$ is the \emph{outer walk} of $G$. We say
than an edge $e$ of $G$ is a chord of the outer walk of $G$ if the edge does not lie on the
boundary of the infinite face but both its ends do. 
\end{definition}

We have the following result for plane graphs:

\begin{theorem}
In a $2$-connected plane graph, each face is bounded by a cycle.
\end{theorem}

Therefore, when talking about $2$-connected graphs, we may refer to the outer walk as the 
\emph{outer cycle}.

Note also that technically plane graphs are not graphs embedded in surfaces, since the plane is
not a surface according to our definition (it is not compact). But by compactifying the plane
we see that embedding a connected graph in the plane is in some sense ``equivalent'' to embedding 
the graph in $S_0$, and we will interchangeably refer to plane graphs and graphs embedded in the 
sphere when convenient. 

\begin{theorem}[Euler's formula]
Let $G$ be a $2$-cell-embedded graph in a surface $\Sigma$. If $G$ has $V$ vertices, $E$ edges and 
$F$ faces, then

\[
V - E + F = \chi(\Sigma)
\]
\end{theorem}

\begin{definition}
A \emph{homotopy} between two functions $f$ and $g$ from a space $X$ to a space $Y$ is a continuous
map $G : X \times [0, 1] \rightarrow Y$ such that $G(x, 0) = f(x)$ and $G(x, 1) = g(x)$. 
Two functions are \emph{homotopic} or \emph{homotopically equivalent} if there is an homotopy
between them. 
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
A \emph{contractible cycle} of a graph $G$ embedded in a surface is a cycle in the graph whose 
embedding is the image of a closed curve homotopic to a constant map.
The \emph{edge-width} $ew(G)$ of an embedded graph $G$ 
is the length of the smallest non-contractible cycle in $G$. 
\end{definition}





\section{Graph Coloring}

Problems related to \emph{coloring} are a fundamental part of graph theory. Although there are many variants, the original one and the most important is \emph{vertex coloring}.

\begin{definition}
A \emph{vertex coloring} of a graph $G$ is a function $\phi : V(G) \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$. The vertex coloring is said to be \emph{proper} if $\forall uv \in E(G), \phi(u) \neq \phi(v)$. 
\end{definition}

We think of this as assigning one color to each vertex of the graph, so that adjacent vertices are assigned different colors. This interpretation comes from the origin of the problem in \textit{map coloring}, in which we have to color a political map assigning colors to countries so that neighboring countries are assigned different colors in order to distinguish them. A quantity of interest is the number of colors required for a proper coloring of the graph:

\begin{definition}
A vertex coloring $\phi$ is said to be a $k$\emph{-coloring} if $|\Im \phi| = k$. A graph $G$ is said to be $k$\emph{-colorable} if it admits a proper $k$-coloring. The \emph{chromatic number} $\chi(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the minimum $k$ such that $G$ is $k$-colorable. 
\end{definition}

In the map coloring context, we study vertex coloring for \emph{planar} graphs. The following remarkable result was the origin of this area of mathematics:

\begin{theorem}[Four color theorem]
For all planar graphs $G$, $\chi(G) \leq 4$.
\end{theorem}

This theorem, originally conjectured in 1852, was proven by Appel and Haken in 1976 \cite{4ct1, 4ct2}. Their proof achieved some notoriety due to use of computers to process a lengthy case analysis. 

A natural generalization of the above problem is to study the chromatic number of graphs embedded in surfaces other than the plane. The following result, due to Heawood in 1890 \cite{heawoodmapcolour}, generalizes the four color theorem to surfaces other than the plane:

\begin{theorem}[Heawood]
Let $\Sigma$ be a surface with Euler genus $g(\Sigma) \geq 1$. Any graph embedded in $\Sigma$ can be colored with

$$
H(\Sigma) = \left\lfloor \frac{7 + \sqrt{1+24g(\Sigma)}}{2} \right\rfloor
$$
colors.
\end{theorem}

We call $H(\Sigma)$ the \emph{Heawood number} of the surface.

The very interesting result is that this bound is tight for all surfaces with $g(\Sigma) \geq 1$
except for $N_2$, the Klein bottle. (It is also tight for the sphere $S_0$, but Heawood's proof
does not work for this case). This was finally proved after much work by Ringel and Youngs:

\begin{theorem}[Ringel-Youngs \cite{ringelyoungs}]
For every surface $\Sigma \neq N_2$, $K_{H(\Sigma)}$ embeds into $\Sigma$.
\end{theorem}

A more recent approach to problems of coloring graphs on surfaces is to ask how the graphs
that are not colorable with a certain number of colors look like, and see if there is any 
algorithmic insight to obtain from that.
For example, is $K_{H(\Sigma)}$ the only graph which is not $H(\Sigma)-1$ colorable?
Any other graph which contains $K_{H(\Sigma)}$ will also chromatic number at least $H(\Sigma)$,
so in order to properly ask this question we need the concept of \emph{critical graphs}.

\begin{definition}
A graph $G$ is \emph{$k$-critical} if $\chi(G) = k$ but $\chi(G') < k$ for any proper subgraph
$G' \subset G$. 
\end{definition}

$k$-critical graphs are the minimal obstructions for $k$-colorability:

\begin{observation}
$\chi(G) \geq k \iff$ $G$ contains a $k$-critical graph as a subgraph.
\end{observation}

\begin{theorem}[Dirac; Albertson, Hutchinson \cite{diracalbertsonhutchinson}]
For $\Sigma \neq N_2, g(\Sigma) \geq 1$, $K_{H(\Sigma)}$ is the only $H(\Sigma)$-critical graph
embeddable in $\Sigma$.
\end{theorem}

This means that determining $H(\Sigma)$-colorability for graphs embedded in $H(\Sigma)$ is 
equivalent to finding an $H(\Sigma)$-clique. 

Is it possible that other simple characterizations exist for graphs on surfaces which are 
not $k$-colorable for $k < H(\Sigma)$? The answer is affirmative:

\begin{theorem}[\cite{thomassenfixedsurface}]
For any surface $\Sigma$ and $k \geq 6$, there exist only finitely many $k$-critical graphs 
embeddable in $\Sigma$.
\end{theorem}

This was proved by Thomassen after previous results by Dirac and Gallai for $k \geq 8$
and $k \geq 7$, $k \geq 8$. It is the best possible bound for $k$ since Fisk \cite{fisk} proved
the existence of infinitely many $5$-critical graphs on the torus.

Let us briefly discuss the algorithmic implications of this result. For a fixed graph $H$, it 
is possible to check whether $H$ is a subgraph of $G$ in time polynomial in the size of $G$.
In fact, by a result of Eppstein \cite{eppstein}, for graphs $G$ in a fixed surface
it is possible to test subgraph isomorphism in linear time. Therefore, for $k \geq 6$ there exists an algorithm for determining $k$-colorability in linear time for graphs on a fixed surface,
by testing subgraph isomorphism with each of the $k$-critical graphs in the finite list. 

We can ask what is the complexity of testing $k$-colorability with $k < 6$ for graphs in fixed 
surfaces.
$1$-colorability and $2$-colorability can be determined in linear time. $3$-colorability is NP-
complete even for planar graphs \cite{3colorabilitynpcomplete}. The complexity of $4$-colorability 
in surfaces other than the
sphere remains an open problem. 

\section{List Coloring}

\todo{Definition of List Coloring}

\missingfigure{figure explaining pictorial notation for list sizes}

\todo{Thomassen's theorem introduction}

\cite{thomassenplanargraphchoosable}

\begin{theorem}[Thomassen's theorem \cite{thomassenplanargraphchoosable}]
\label{thomassentheorem}
For all planar graphs $G$, $\chi_{\ell}(G) \leq 5$.
\end{theorem}

Thomassen actually proved a stronger theorem: 

\begin{theorem}[Thomassen's stronger theorem]
\label{thomassenstrongertheorem}
	Let $G$ be a plane (embedded) graph with outer walk $C$, and let $L$ be a list assignment satisfying:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $|L(v)| \geq 5$ for all internal vertices.
	\item $|L(v)| \geq 3$ for all $v \in V(C) \setminus \{x, y\}$ where $x, y$ are a pair of adjacent vertices.
	\item $|L(x)| = |L(y)| = 1$, $L(x) \neq L(y)$. 
\end{itemize}	
	Then $G$ is $L$-colorable.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Suppose we have a counterexample with minimal $|V(G)|$. It is clear that for 
$|V(G)| \leq 3$ the theorem is true, so we assume $|V(G)| \geq 4$.

First we prove that $G$ is $2$-connected. Assume it is not. Then, we have two subgraphs $G_1, G_2 \subset G$ with $G_1 \cup G_2 = G$ 
and $G_1 \cap G_2 = \{v\}$, with $v$ a cutvertex. Assume, without loss of generality, that $x, y \in G_1$. By minimality of $G$, 
$G_1$ is $L\restriction_{G_1}$ colorable. Let $\phi_1$ be a coloring of $G_1$. Now, let $w$ be a neighbor of $v$ in the outer face 
of $G_2$ and consider the list assignment $L'$ for $G_2$ for which $L'(v) = \{\phi_1(v)\}$, $L'(w) = c$ for some arbitrary 
$c \in L(w)$, and $L'(u) = L(u)$ $\forall u \in V(G_2) \setminus \{v, w\}$. Note that $G_2$ and $L'$ satisfy the hypothesis 
of the theorem. Therefore, by minimality of our counterexample, $G_2$ has a $L'$-coloring $\phi_2$. But now note that, since 
$\phi_1(v) = \phi_2(v)$, the coloring $\phi(u) = \phi_i(u)$ if $u \in V(G_i)$ is well-defined and is an $L$-coloring of $G$, 
contradiction.

Hence, $G$ is $2$-connected and the outer walk $C$ is a cycle. Now we prove that there is no chord in $C$. The proof is 
similar to the above argument. Assume there is a chord $vw$. Then, we have two subgraphs $G_1, G_2 \subset G$ with 
$G_1 \cup G_2 = G$, $G_1 \cap G_2 = \{v, w\}$ and ${x, y} \subset G_1$. By minimality of $G$, $G_1$ has an $L$-coloring $\phi_1$. 
If we set $L'(v) = \{\phi_1(v)\}$, $L'(w) = \{\phi_1(w)\}$, and $L'(u) = L(u)$ for all other vertices 
$u \in V(G_2) \setminus \{v, w\}$, then $G_2$ is $L'$-colorable and a coloring of $G$ can be constructed.

Now we have that $G$ has no chords or cutvertices. Let $u$ be the neighbor of $y$ in the outer face other than 
$x$ and let $v$ be the neighbor of $u$ in the outer face other than $y$ (possibly $v = x$). Let  
$\{c_1, c_2\} \subseteq L(u) \ L(y)$. Now, let $G'$ be the graph obtained by removing $u$ from $G$ and let $L'$ be 
the list assignment for $G'$ in which $\{c_1, c_2\}$ are removed from the lists of the neighbors of $u$ other than 
$v$. $G'$ satisfies the hypothesis of the theorem: every vertex in the outer face has list size at least $3$, since each of those
vertices is
either a vertex previously in the outer face of $G$ all of which have their previous lists (the only neighbors of $u$ in 
the outer face are $u$ and $y$, since $G$ has no chords), or a previously interior vertex, which has had at most $2$ of its
$\geq 5$ colors removed. So $G'$ has an $L'$-coloring, which can be extended to an $L$-coloring of $G$ by coloring $u$ with one
of $c_1$ or $c_2$ (whichever is not in use by $v$), contradiction.

\todo{Criticality definition. Discuss it}

In coloring problems, it is useful to consider when a precoloring of a subgraph
does not \emph{extend} to the entire graph, that is, there is no coloring
of the entire graph under certain constraints which agrees with the coloring 
of the subgraph. 




\begin{definition}[Extending]
	Let $G$ be a graph, $T \subseteq G$ a subgraph, and $L$ a list assignment
	for $G$. For an $L$-coloring $\phi$ of $T$, we say that $\phi$ \emph{extends}
	to an $L$-coloring of $G$ if there exists an $L$-coloring $\psi$ of $G$
s	such that $\phi(v) = \psi(v)$ for all $v \in V(T)$. 
	
\end{definition}

It is also interesting to consider graphs which are critical in this setting. To do so, we use the following definition (from \cite{fivelistcoloring2}):

\begin{definition}[$T$-critical]
	Let $G$, $T$, $L$ be as above. The graph $G$ is \emph{$T$-critical with respect to $L$} if for every proper subgraph $G' \subset G$ such that $T \subseteq G'$, there exists an $L$-coloring of $T$ that extends to an $L$-coloring of $G'$, but does not extend to an $L$-coloring of $G$. If the list assignment $L$ is clear from context, we just say \emph{$T$-critical}.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[$\phi$-critical]
	Let, $G$, $T$, $L$ be as above. The graph $G$ is $\phi$-critical for a coloring $\phi$ of $T$ if $\phi$ extends to every proper subgraph of $G$ containing $T$ but not to $G$.
\end{definition}

In a way similar to the general notion of criticality, we have that graphs for which colorings of $T$ do not extend contain a non-trivial $T$-critical subgraph:

\begin{lemma}
Let $G$ be a graph, $T$ a subgraph, and $L$ a list assignment for $G$. If there 
is an $L$-coloring $\phi$ of $T$ that does not extend to $G$, 
then $G$ contains a subgraph $H$ with $T \subsetneq H$ which 
is $\phi$-critical, and hence also $T$-critical with respect 
to $L\restriction_H$. 
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $\phi$ be the coloring of $T$ that does not extend and let $H$ be a minimal subgraph 
of $G$ for which $\phi$ does not extend. Now note that $H$ is $\phi$-critical 
by construction.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{minimalsubgraphlemma}
Let $G$ be a graph, $T$ a subgraph, $L$ a list assignment for $G$, and $H \supseteq T$ 
a subgraph of $G$ which is minimal with respect to the following property: 
for every $L$-coloring $\phi$ of $T$ that extends to $H$, $\phi$ also extends to $G$. 
Then $H$ is $T$-critical.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Suppose not. Then, $H$ contains a proper subgraph $H'$ so that every $L$-coloring $\phi$ that extends to $H'$ also extends to $H$ and hence to $G$. But then $H'$ is a smaller subgraph with that property, contradiction. 
\end{proof}

We also have the following lemma from \cite{fivelistcoloring2}:

\begin{lemma}
\label{pregluinglemma}
Let $T$ be a subgraph of a graph $G$ such that $G$ is $T$-critical with respect to a list assignment $L$. Let $A, B \subseteq G$ be such that $A \cup B = G$ and $T \subseteq A$. Then $G[V(B)]$ is $A[V(A) \cap V(B)]$-critical.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} 
Let $G' = G[V(B)]$ and $S = A[V(A) \cap V(B)]$. If $G' = S$ there is nothing to say, suppose otherwise that $G' \neq S$ and note that therefore $G'$ contains an edge not in $S$ (in fact, all isolated vertices of $G'$ must be in $S$). Suppose for a contradiction that $G'$ is not $S$-critical. Then, by taking a maximal proper subgraph that defies the defintion, there exists an edge $e \in E(G') \setminus E(S)$ such that every $L$-coloring of $S$ that extends to $G' \setminus e$ also extends to $G'$. Since $G$ is $T$-critical and $e \not\in E(T)$, there exists a coloring $\phi\restriction_T$ of $T$ that extends to an $L$-coloring $\phi$ of $G \setminus e$, but does not extend to an $L$-coloring of $G$. However, by the choice of $e$, the restriction $\phi\restriction_S$ extends to an $L$-coloring $\phi'$ of $G'$. Let $\phi''$ be such that $\phi''(v) = \phi'(v) \, \forall v \in V(G')$ and $\phi''(v) = \phi(v) \, \forall v \in V(G) \setminus V(G')$. Now, since $A \cup B = G$, $\phi''$ is an $L$-coloring of $G$ extending $\phi\restriction_T$, a contradiction.
\end{proof}

For us, it will be more useful in this form: \todo{check if this is the best phrasing}

\begin{lemma}[Gluing Lemma]
\label{gluinglemma}
Let $T$ be a subgraph of a graph $G$ such that $G$ is $T$-critical with respect to a list assignment $L$. Let $A, B \subseteq G$ be such that $A \cup B = G$. Then $G[V(B)]$ is $(A[V(A) \cap V(B)] \cup T)$-critical.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} 
Apply \ref{pregluinglemma} to $A' = A \cup T$ and $B' = B$. 
\end{proof}

\missingfigure{Gluing lemma illustration}

The reason we decided to name it ``Gluing lemma'' in this work is that it is useful to visualize the graph $G$ as made of two separate pieces, $A$ and $B$, which are glued together along $A[V(A) \cap V(B)]$. In our approach we will frequently use the fact that all $T$-critical graphs can be ``decomposed'' in this way.
