\chapter{Approaches to the Two Precolored Triangles Theorem}

In this chapter we explain different approaches to proving Conjecture \ref{twotriangleconjecture}.

\section{Cycle-Canvas Strangulation}

We can generate all critical prism-canvases whose two triangles are at distance $d$ from critical
cycle-canvases with cycle size $2d+6$. Here is how:


\begin{proposition}
Let $G$ be a plane graph $(T_1 \cup T_2)$-critical with respect to some list assignment $L$, 
where $T_1$ and $T_2$ are two triangles 
and $P$ is a shortest path between them of length $d$. Let $G'$ be the graph
obtained by ``duplicating'' the $d+1$ vertices of path $P$, so that the edges of the path $P$ are
duplicated and the other neighbors of the duplicated vertices are now neighbors of the vertex
corresponding to the side of the path in which the neighbors were in (see Figure 
\ref{fig:strangulation}). Let $C$ be the corresponding cycle of length $2d+6$ that is newly formed
with the duplicated vertices and the vertices of the triangles. Then $G'$ is $C$-critical (with 
respect to the naturally corresponding list assignment $L'$).
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
By the Extension Lemma (\ref{extensionlemma}), $G$ is $(T_1 \cup T_2 \cup P)$-critical.
Now, the result follows by the Duplication Lemma (\ref{duplicationlemma}).
\end{proof}

Now, we use this result in the backwards direction (as in Figure \ref{fig:strangulation}):
from critical cycle-canvases of cycle size $2d+6$, we generate candidates for critical 
prism-canvases by identifying $d+1$ consecutive vertices in the precolored cycle with the opposite
segment of $d+1$ consecutive vertices in the precolored cycle (it is useful to visualize 
the``inverted'' canvas, so that the precolored cycle is no longer the outer face but a cycle
bounding an interior face). Note that from each cycle-canvas there are $d+3$ ways to identify
the vertices. After criticality testing all candidates from all cycle-canvases of size $2d+6$, we
obtain all critical prism-canvases of distance $d$.

This can serve to get the list of
all critical prism-canvases with the triangles at a certain distance, which is useful
for a part of our plan and to experimentally determine the value of the right distance constant
in Conjecture \ref{twotriangleconjecture}.
However it is not useful, just by itself, to prove that there are no such critical prism-canvases
for large enough distances.
